# Used Car Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning application that predicts used car prices using a **Multiple Linear Regression** model. It includes steps such as data preprocessing, outlier handling, feature engineering, model training, evaluation (using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²), and saving the final model.

## Files

- `used_car_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow with code, charts, and explanations.
- `used_car_lr_model.py`: Contains core functions for data preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and evaluation.
- `used_car_lr_model.pkl`: Saved Linear Regression model (binary format).
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
